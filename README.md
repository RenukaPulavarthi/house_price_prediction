## House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices based on various features like land size, number of rooms, and facilities using **Random Forest Regression**. The model is trained on over 1 million data points to ensure robust predictive reliability.

## Features
- Predicts house prices based on input features.
- Uses **Random Forest Regression** for high accuracy.
- Processes large datasets efficiently.
- Provides data visualizations for insights.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn  

## Dataset
The dataset includes features like:  
- **Area (sqft)**
- **Number of rooms**
- **Location**
- **Facilities (e.g., parking, garden, etc.)**  
The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers.
